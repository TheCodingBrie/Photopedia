            text: "in sparsely populated Westhavelland, around 70 kilometres to the west of Berlin, you can even find one of the darkest spots in the whole country. Amateur astronomers are ideally catered for here, with guided tours and photography courses as well as astro-friendly accommodation with binoculars and telescopes. And the sights you can spot on clear nights are amazing. As well being able to see the Milky Way with the naked eye, there's also a chance to observe the airglow, faint light from higher atmospheric layers. The US non-governmental organisation International Dark Sky Association (IDA) designated Westhavelland Nature Park as Germany's first Dark Sky Reserve in 2014. The darkest point is in the core area between the small towns of GÃ¼lpe and Nennhausen. Visitors can seek out nine marked observation points and from there view thousands of stars and planets, and with a little luck, perhaps some shooting stars and comets too."
