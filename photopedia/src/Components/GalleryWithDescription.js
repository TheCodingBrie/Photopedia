                    <h4>Westhavelland</h4>
                    <p>
                      In sparsely populated Westhavelland, around 70 kilometres
                      to the west of Berlin, you can even find one of the
                      darkest spots in the whole country. Amateur astronomers
                      are ideally catered for here, with guided tours and
                      photography courses as well as astro-friendly
                      accommodation with binoculars and telescopes. And the
                      sights you can spot on clear nights are amazing. As well
                      being able to see the Milky Way with the naked eye,
                      there's also a chance to observe the airglow, faint light
                      from higher atmospheric layers. The US non-governmental
                      organisation International Dark Sky Association (IDA)
                      designated Westhavelland Nature Park as Germany's first
                      Dark Sky Reserve in 2014. The darkest point is in the core
                      area between the small towns of Gülpe and Nennhausen.
                      Visitors can seek out nine marked observation points and
                      from there view thousands of stars and planets, and with a
                      little luck, perhaps some shooting stars and comets too.

                    <p>
                      Around the world, the IDA has recognised around 40 regions
                      in which artificial light has been eliminated to a great
                      extent and the dark night sky is protected. As well as
                      focusing on attractions for tourists, the organisation
                      also has an educational role. It works to disseminate
                      astronomical knowledge, raise awareness of the night sky
                      as a cultural asset and inform people of the consequences
                      of light smog. This phenomenon can irritate nocturnal
                      animals and birds or disrupt plants' growth cycles. A
                      transition between light and dark is an important time
                      mechanism for ecosystems and for us humans too. htyears

                    <p>
                      Visitors can also find darkness in the Eifel region on the
                      border with Belgium and Luxembourg – a kind of island in
                      the otherwise densely populated state of North
                      Rhine-Westphalia. The Eifel Nature Park, some 65
                      kilometres south-west of Cologne, is mainly spared from
                      artificial light sources and was recognised by the IDA as
                      a Dark Sky Reserve in 2019. Here too, you can see the
                      shimmering white stripe of the Milky Way on clear nights
                      to a level of detail possible in just a few places in
                      Europe. Another attraction is the astronomy workshop
                      "Sterne ohne Grenzen" (Stars Without Borders) at the
                      Vogelsang observatory. Guided star tours are available
                      here in German and English – including equipment such as
                      telescopes and large binoculars. While balmy summer nights
                      are perhaps more pleasant, winter is a particularly good
                      time for stargazers for one reason alone: the nights are
                      longer and start early. This makes it possible for
                      families with children to come along and look at the stars
                      without staying up too late.

                    <p>
                      At a lofty height, although not quite all the way to the
                      stars, is the Winkl-Moosalm, the astronomical alternative
                      at 1,200 metres in the Chiemgau Alps. The first Dark Sky
                      Reserve in the Alps, the Winkelmoosalm is a great place
                      for hiking in summer and a varied ski area in winter – the
                      one constant being the 360-degree panoramic view. When
                      darkness falls, an unparalleled firmament appears on clear
                      alpine nights. It's possible to spot details of the Milky
                      Way, galactic nebulae or red giants, large and very bright
                      stars, in the constellation of Taurus, for instance.
                      During guided tours, astronomers provide live explanations
                      of space, using a special laser pointer for extra clarity.

                    <p>
                      Recognition by the Dark Sky Association is an honour, but
                      Germany has even more top spots for stargazers, although
                      without the IDA label. Many public observatories, for
                      example in Sankt Andreasberg in the Upper Harz, are
                      currently seeking recognition as an IDA Dark Sky Reserve.
                      Talks are given here and telescopes are available; there
                      is also a planetarium as a bad weather alternative. Like
                      the Swabian Alb Biosphere Reserve in the south of Germany,
                      the observatory in Harz is also seeking recognition as an
                      IDA Dark Sky Reserve. It can also get extremely dark on
                      some North Sea islands, such as Amrum, Pellworm or
                      Spiekeroog. The IDA measured the darkest sky over Germany
                      to date on the island of Spiekeroog. The island in the
                      Lower Saxon Wadden Sea is also seeking certification,
                      which would make it Germany's first Dark Sky Island.
